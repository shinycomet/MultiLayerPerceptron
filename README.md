# MultilayerPerceptron in C++

### Brief description

A multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a class of feed-forward artificial neural network (NN). A MLP consists of, at least, three layers of nodes: an input layer, a hidden layer and an output layer. Except for the input nodes, each node is a neuron that uses a nonlinear activation function. 
(Wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron).

### Implemented *activation functions*
In artificial neural networks, the activation function of a node defines the output of that node given an input or set of inputs.
(Wikipedia : wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_function)

### How to use
At the root of the project type :
```makefile
in terminal type :
make 

then :
/bin/main --help : ask for help

or

/bin/main a b c d e f
a: Number of iterations (epochs) (unsigned)
b: Learning rate (float),
c: Number of inputs (unsigned),
d: Number of hidden layers (unsigned),
e: Number of neurons per layer (unsigned),
f: Number of outputs (unsigned)


```

### *Status update*
